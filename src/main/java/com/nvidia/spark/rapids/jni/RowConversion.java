  /**
   * Convert this table of columns into a row major format that is useful for interacting with other
   * systems that do row major processing of the data. Currently only fixed-width column types are
   * supported.
   * <p/>
   * The output is one or more ColumnVectors that are lists of bytes. A ColumnVector that is a
   * list of bytes can have at most 2GB of data stored in it. Multiple ColumnVectors are returned
   * if not all of the data can fit in a single one.
   * <p/>
   * Each row in the returned ColumnVector array corresponds to a row in the input table. The rows
   * will be in the same order as the input Table. The first ColumnVector in the array will hold
   * the first N rows followed by the second ColumnVector and so on.  The following illustrates
   * this and also shows some of the internal structure that will be explained later.
   * <p/><pre>
   * result[0]:
   *  | row 0 | validity for row 0 | padding |
   *  ...
   *  | row N | validity for row N | padding |
   *  result[1]:
   *  |row N+1 | validity for row N+1 | padding |
   *  ...
   * </pre>
   *
   * The format of each row is similar in layout to a C struct where each column will have padding
   * in front of it to align it properly. Each row has padding inserted at the end so the next row
   * is aligned to a 64-bit boundary. This is so that the first column will always start at the
   * beginning (first byte) of the list of bytes and each row has a consistent layout for fixed
   * width types.
   * <p/>
   * Validity bytes are added to the end of the row. There will be one byte for each 8 columns in a
   * row. Because the validity is byte aligned there is no padding between it and the last column
   * in the row.
   * <p/>
   * For example a table consisting of the following columns A, B, C with the corresponding types
   * <p/><pre>
   *   | A - BOOL8 (8-bit) | B - INT16 (16-bit) | C - DURATION_DAYS (32-bit) |
   * </pre>
   * <p/>
   *  Will have a layout that looks like
   *  <p/><pre>
   *  | A_0 | P | B_0 | B_1 | C_0 | C_1 | C_2 | C_3 | V0 | P | P | P | P | P | P | P |
   * </pre>
   * <p/>
   * In this P corresponds to a byte of padding, [LETTER]_[NUMBER] represents the NUMBER
   * byte of the corresponding LETTER column, and V[NUMBER] is a validity byte for the `NUMBER * 8`
   * to `(NUMBER + 1) * 8` columns.
   * <p/>
   * The order of the columns will not be changed, but to reduce the total amount of padding it is
   * recommended to order the columns in the following way.
   * <p/>
   * <ol>
   *  <li>64-bit columns</li>
   *  <li>32-bit columns</li>
   *  <li>16-bit columns</li>
   *  <li>8-bit columns</li>
   * </ol>
   * <p/>
   * This way padding is only inserted at the end of a row to make the next column 64-bit aligned.
   * So for the example above if the columns were ordered C, B, A the layout would be.
   * <pre>
   * | C_0 | C_1 | C_2 | C_3 | B_0 | B_1 | A_0 | V0 |
   * </pre>
   * This would have reduced the overall size of the data transferred by half.
   * <p/>
   * One of the main motivations for doing a row conversion on the GPU is to avoid cache problems
   * when walking through columnar data on the CPU in a row wise manner. If you are not transferring
   * very many columns it is likely to be more efficient to just pull back the columns and walk
   * through them. This is especially true of a single column of fixed width data. The extra
   * padding will slow down the transfer and looking at only a handful of buffers is not likely to
   * cause cache issues.
   * <p/>
   * There are some limits on the size of a single row.  If the row is larger than 1KB this will
   * throw an exception.

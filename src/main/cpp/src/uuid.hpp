/**
 * @brief Generate a column of UUIDs (String type) with `rowCount` rows.
 * Spark uses `Truly Random or Pseudo-Random` UUID type which is described in
 * the section 4.4 of [RFC4122](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122),
 * The variant in UUID is 2 and the version in UUID is 4. This implementation
 * generates UUIDs in the same format, but does not generate the same UUIDs as
 * Spark. This function is deterministic, meaning that it will generate
 * the same UUIDs for the same seed and row count.
 *
 * E.g.: "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
 *
 * @param rowCount Number of UUIDs to generate
 * @param seed Seed for random number generation
 * @return ColumnVector containing UUIDs

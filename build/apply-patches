# Apply pattches to CUDF is problematic in a number of ways. But ultimately it comes down to
# making sure that a user can do development work in spark-rapids-jni without the patches
# getting in the way
# The operations I really want to support no matter what state CUDF is in are
# 1) Build the repo from scratch
# 2) Rebuild the repo without having to clean and start over
# 3) upmerge to a new version of the plugin including updating the cudf submodule
#
# Building from scratch is simple. We want clean to unapply any patches and 
# build to apply them. But if we want to rebuild without a clean we need to know what
# state the CUDF repo is in. Did we apply patches to it or not. The fastest way to do this
# is to save some state files about what happened. But a user could mess with CUDF directly
# so we want to have ways to double check that they are indeed correct.
